C Program to Check Armstrong Number
C Program to Check Armstrong Number
In this example, you will learn to check whether an integer entered by the user is an Armstrong number or not.

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following C programming topics:

C if...else Statement
C while and do...while Loop
A positive integer is called an Armstrong number (of order n) if

abcd... = an + bn + cn + dn + 
In the case of an Armstrong number of 3 digits, the sum of cubes of each digit is equal to the number itself. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because

153 = 1*1*1 + 5*5*5 + 3*3*3 
Check Armstrong Number of three digits
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int num, originalNum, remainder, result = 0;
    printf("Enter a three-digit integer: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);
    originalNum = num;

    while (originalNum != 0) {
       // remainder contains the last digit
        remainder = originalNum % 10;
        
       result += remainder * remainder * remainder;
        
       // removing last digit from the orignal number
       originalNum /= 10;
    }

    if (result == num)
        printf("%d is an Armstrong number.", num);
    else
        printf("%d is not an Armstrong number.", num);

    return 0;
}
